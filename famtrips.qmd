My Sister, Jane, and I were actually quite bored with European Tourism and decided to do shenanigans instead of taking photos of the scenery. Shenanigans can be seen as follows:

REDACTED: We went to Europe (not Spain) when I was thirteen years old. Same takeaway as Spain as a sixteen year old: its just... not that interesting. The most memorable takeaway of the trip was shenanigans with Jane, sitting for hours in the car going deliriously silly from boredom. Therefore I will not be sharing any photos from that trip because I didn't care for it.\]

Moving on,
