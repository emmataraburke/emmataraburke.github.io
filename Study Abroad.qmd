title: "Study Abroad"
---

In the fall of 2023, I studied abroad in Chile. The program was titled "Socio-Ecological Sustainability" and our classes focused on conservation strategies and ethics, and the intersection of culture and environment. Attending this program was such a privilege, especially because we were able to go on so many field trips out in nature, conduct our own research, and meet and talk with Indigenous Mapuche people. Below I will attach some of my work that I completed while I was abroad:

[Ethnographic Report of Villarrica - Relationships to Medicinal Plants](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EDiDpCC0uDbglzzoM2_S99DqxnoNIDJwoiipCSh_06M/edit?usp=sharing)

One of the most special things we did on our program was conduct our own research project in groups. My group chose to study community gardens. We had the opportunity to interview 5 Mapuche women who owned and tended their own land and gardens in the region. This is our final report:
