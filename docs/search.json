    "text": "SPAIN\n\n\nMy Sister, Jane, and I were actually quite bored with European Tourism and decided to do shenanigans instead of taking photos of the scenery. Shenanigans can be seen as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREDACTED: We went to Europe (not Spain) when I was thirteen years old. Same takeaway as Spain as a sixteen year old: its just… not that interesting. The most memorable takeaway of the trip was shenanigans with Jane, sitting for hours in the car going deliriously silly from boredom. Therefore I will not be sharing any photos from that trip because I didn’t care for it.]\nMoving on,\nMEXICO! 2015\n\nView from inside the cenote in Quintana Roo\n\nMy cousin Fabrice in the cenote\n\nJane swimming, shot on iphone 6 with my first water proof phone case.\n\nMy dad swimming\n\nSelfie of the cousins: (left to right) Emma, Jane, Molly, and Sam"

    "text": "This is a place where I will tell the story of “Wheres Emma?”\nThat question became a running joke in my family because when I was just born, the first thing my older sister would do was ask “Wheres Emma?!” as soon as she got home from preschool. As an infant, I was usually located within the confines of the household, usually stationary, limited to wherever my parents would carry me.\nNowadays, both my sister and my parents are unconcerned with my whereabouts. Just this past winter I told them I was going to Brazil and they didn’t bat an eye or ask any further questions. It is up to me now to answer the unasked question of “Where’s Emma?”\nWhen I was seven years old my family decided it would be a good time to take me and my sister on a five week trip to Thailand with our Grandmother who grew up there. While I wish I was a little older to remember everything, this trip really stuck with me. I think the vastly different climate and culture made a lasting impression. It was the most incredible journey I had experienced.\nAs I got older and gained independence, I started traveling with friends. When I was 13 I went to England with my two best friends and we exercised our independence and autonomy, navigating trains and buses to explore the country (and staying with my friend Daisy’s grandparents of course.) Later on I signed up for a youth educational trip to take me back to Thailand and Vietnam, where I met my distant relatives on my Grandmother’s side. There I studied access to education in rural settings.\nTwo years later I did another trip to the Dominican Republic to study public health. This was the first country I went to where I could practice speaking Spanish.\nMy Spanish skills were cemented when I studied abroad in Chile for three months. It was a wonderful educational experience and the most academically engaged I have ever been. After studying abroad I decided to go on a long trip through Uruguay and Brazil with my friends. We already had experience traveling together in Mexico, so we were ready for another big adventure.\nSince being in College, I have been to Mexico, Hawaii, Uruguay, Brazil, and Puerto Rico with a variety of friends. I have learned a lot from traveling with friends. I have gotten to see them pushed to their limits and tested in new settings with new challenges. Sometimes friendships faltered after long exhaustive travel, other times they were strengthened. In any case, I am confident enough in my travel experiences and my language abilities that I am ready to travel alone.\nI am ready for solitude. I am ready for adventure. Where will I go next?"

    "text": "In the fall of 2023, I studied abroad in Chile. The program was titled “Socio-Ecological Sustainability” and our classes focused on conservation strategies and ethics, and the intersection of culture and environment. Attending this program was such a privilege, especially because we were able to go on so many field trips out in nature, conduct our own research, and meet and talk with Indigenous Mapuche people. Below I will attach some of my work that I completed while I was abroad:\nOpinion Editorial on Social Perceptions of Conservation Approaches\nPaper on Forest Conservation Strategy\nEthnographic Report of Villarrica - Relationships to Medicinal Plants\nOne of the most special things we did on our program was conduct our own research project in groups. My group chose to study community gardens. We had the opportunity to interview 5 Mapuche women who owned and tended their own land and gardens in the region. This is our final report:\nSustaining the Work: Community Gardens in the Tolten River Basin"
