Hey! Welcome to my travel blog. My name is Emma Burke and I am currently a graduating senior at UCSB, studying Environmental Science. Despite knowing that planes are terrible for the environment, I absolutely love travelling. I am so grateful for all the opportunities I have had to travel and I thank my parents for taking me on trips and sparking my curiosity to explore new places. This website is essentially an online photo album for myself and family and friends.
