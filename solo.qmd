  title: Solo Journeys

Here I am going to document my not-so-solo travels that were sponsored by Rustic Pathways, a company that leads youth trips either for tourism or community service or educational purposes. My trip to Vietnam and Thailand was focused on studying access to education. The trip to the Dominican Republic was focused on public health. Both trips were great experiences.
