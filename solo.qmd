Here I am going to document my not-so-solo travels that were sponsored by Rustic Pathways, a company that leads youth trips either for tourism or community service or educational purposes. My trip to Vietnam and Thailand was focused on studying access to education. The trip to the Dominican Republic was focused on public health. Both trips were great experiences.

Before joining my friends on the Rustic Pathways trip, I met my Aunt and her family for the first time. Despite the language barrier we had a lot of fun exploring Hanoi and surrounding rural areas of Vietnam.

Me, Kelsey and Kenzie on a boat to an Island to celebrate finishing our service project which involved mixing a lot of concrete to make floors for houses and benches for the neighborhood.
